# Gmail Integration for Alexa

This makes email work more like voice mail, with particular focus on older users and others with difficulty using tablets and computers.  

Users can review, erase, mark read/unread/starred/unstrarred, send messages and attachments to cloud printers, and say "show me" to send images or last speech to a tablet or the Fire TV.

This skill is live on Amazon, and can be installed from the Alexa app.  User information is on <a href="http://email-skill.blogspot.com">my Blogger page.</a>

Developer info for those who wish to tweak it are posted as a <a href="https://www.hackster.io/user1681818436/gmail-for-alexa-3fd61a">project on hackster.io</a> and will be here soon.
