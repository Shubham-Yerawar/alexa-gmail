# Gmail integration for Alexa

This makes email work more like voice mail, with particular focus on older users and others with difficulty using tablets and computers.  

Users can review, erase, mark read/unread/starred/unstrarred, send messages and attachments to cloud printers, and say "show me" to send images or last speech to a tablet or the Fire TV.

User information is at http://email-skill.blogspot.com

Developer info will be here soon, but instructions are posted as a [project on hackster.io] (https://www.hackster.io/user1681818436/gmail-for-alexa-3fd61a)
